Buying House Accessories Management System
This program is designed for a Buying House—a company that takes clothing or apparel orders from international brands and manages the full production process through local garment factories.
In many buying houses, employees must manually remember inventory items like:
* Zippers
* Buttons
* Threads
* Labels
* Elastics
* Packaging materials
* Tags, etc.
This manual process is very inefficient and can lead to mistakes such as shortages, overstocking, or forgetting items. Because of this problem, and since your family runs a buying house (started in 2016), you created a small computer program to help track these accessories easily.
This program helps the employees of a buying house to store, view, search, delete, and calculate the total stock valueof accessories.

🔧 What This Program Can Do (in Buying House Context)
1️⃣ Add New Accessory to Inventory
Employees can enter:
* Accessory Name → e.g., "Zipper", "Wooden Button", "Poly Bag"
* Price per unit
* Quantity in stock
This helps track exactly what is available in the store.

2️⃣ Display Full Inventory
Shows a complete list of all accessories currently available.
Example output:

1. Zipper | Price: 10.00 | Qty: 500 | Cost: 5000.00
2. Button | Price: 2.00  | Qty: 1200 | Cost: 2400.00
This feature acts like a digital inventory sheet.

3️⃣ Search Any Accessory
Employees can quickly check if an item exists and how much of it is available.
Useful for questions like:
* “Do we have 8-inch zippers?”
* “Do we have enough buttons for tomorrow’s production?”

4️⃣ Delete an Accessory
If an accessory is no longer used, or wrongly entered, it can be removed from the inventory.
This keeps the system clean.

5️⃣ Calculate Total Inventory Value
Shows the total stock value in Taka.
This is very useful for:
* Monthly financial reports
* Stock valuation
* Audit preparation
Example:

TOTAL MONEY SPENT ON ACCESSORIES: 48,200.00

6️⃣ Exit
Closes the program safely.
